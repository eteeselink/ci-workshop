RUNNING STUFF
=============
Open a command-line window and navigate to the source code repository root directory. Then enter the following commands:

  To get started:
    > ENV\Scripts\activate

  To run the program:
    > python log_genius.py

  To run the automated tests:
    > python -m unittest

Initially, the last command should print something like:

    Ran 5 tests in 0.001s

    OK

If it did not, something went wrong. Ask a colleague or the teacher.


INSTALLING PYTHON CORRECTLY
===========================
If everything went right, you already did this, but if you didn't:

* Download Python 3.4.1 or later (x86) for Windows from https://www.python.org/download. 
  * Get the MSI installer
  * Make sure the options "Install PIP" and "Add Python to PATH" are ticked.
* Open a command-line window and navigate to the source code repository root directory. Then enter the following commands:
  > pip install virtualenv
  > virtualenv --python=C:\YOUR\PYTHON\PATH\python34.exe ENV
  > ENV\Scripts\activate
  > ENV\Scripts\pip install pygal

If you never used the command line before, find help from a colleague who did.

What the above does, is install some dependencies into a virtual python environment. Therefore, if 
different python code on your system has conflicting dependencies, things will still work.

Now, in the same directory, create a file called `makebar.py` with the following contents:

  import pygal                                                       # First import pygal
  bar_chart = pygal.Bar()                                            # Then create a bar graph object
  bar_chart.add('Fibonacci', [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55])  # Add some values
  bar_chart.render_to_file('bar_chart.svg')                          # Save the svg to a file

Save it, and run:

 > python makebar.py

You should see a bar_chart.svg file appear in the same directory. Delete makebar.py again.
